# leaflet-challenge

This module 5 challenge has us looking at the United Sttes Geological Survey to visual current and ever changing (every 5 minutes) data on the website.  This challenge has 2 seperate parts, part 1 - the required section, and part 2 - the bonus.

### Programs / Skill Sets
- HTML
- JavaScript
- GeoJSON 
- Leaflet

## Part 1 | Create the Earthquake Visualization (Required)
We are asked to visualize the eqarthquake data sete provided by the USGS GeoJSON feed. The data set will need to be imported and visualized by using leaflet to create the map based on location (latitude and longitute). Each earthquake will be marked on the map by utilizing varing colors and marker seixes to show the size and magnitude of each earthquake.  Creating pop-ups to show additional information when the markers is clicked. 

## Part 2 | Gather and Plot More Data (Bonus)
Create a second plat to show the relationship between seismic activity and tectonic plates. This data will need to be pulled in with our Part 1 data for this portion. As this is the bonus, we can choose different base maps and layer controls to show the different information.
